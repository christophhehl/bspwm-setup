Setup for EndeavourOS (XFCE)
----------------------------
This repository contains my configuration files and a makefile to automatically install all programs needed, copy those configuration files to their respective locations and update all configuration files back into this repository.

### Prerequisites

This setup is supposed to be used with a system running EndeavourOS (with the XFCE desktop environment).
Most installations will most likely work on any Arch-based distributions, however installing bspwm with this setup will most definitely miss many programs for a properly working system.

### Usage

Clone this repository and use the makefile to install the programs and set the configuration files:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/christophhehl/linux-setup.git
...
$ cd linux-setup
$ make help
Linux setup by Christoph Hehl - 2024

help                           Prints this text.
...
```
